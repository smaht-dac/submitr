info:
	@: $(info Here are some 'make' options:)
	   $(info - Use 'make configure' to install poetry, though 'make build' will do it automatically.)
	   $(info - Use 'make lint' to check style with flake8.)
	   $(info - Use 'make build' to install dependencies using poetry.)
	   $(info - Use 'make preview-locally' to build and a local doc tree and open it for preview.)
	   $(info - Use 'make publish' to publish this library, but only if auto-publishing has failed.)
	   $(info - Use 'make retest' to run failing tests from the previous test run.)
	   $(info - Use 'make test' to run tests with the normal options we use for CI/CD like GA.)
	   $(info - Use 'make update' to update dependencies (and the lock file))
	   $(info - Use 'make clear-poetry-cache' to clear the poetry pypi cache if in a bad state. (Safe, but later recaching can be slow.))
