.. tip::
    This documentation covers the `mechanics` of using ``smaht-submitr``.
    It does not at this time cover the `semantics` of the metadata;
    though there is an `Object Model <object_model.html>`_ reference.
    For more information on this aspect of submission please see: **TBD**


System Requirements
===================

* ``python`` `3.9, 3.10, or 3.11`

.. note::
    These instructions are targeted specifically for **Mac OS X** users.
    For **Linux** users, these should be generally applicable (with some modifications);
    presumed to be a bit more advanced, such users should have little difficulty.
    For **Windows** users, very little testing has been done; not recommended; but more experienced users should be able to work through it.


What To Do Next
===============

More experienced users who already have Python installed
to their satisfaction can proceed to instructions for `Installation <installation.html>`_.

Less experienced users should start with instructions
for `Installation Prerequisites <installation_prerequisites.html>`_,
which will introduce some basics for working with the terminal
and installing the dependencies for this tool:
