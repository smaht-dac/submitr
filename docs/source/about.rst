Reporting Issues
----------------

If you experience issues with this software, please do not hesitate to report them to
`smhelp@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net <mailto:smhelp@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net>`_.
Please include as much relevant information as you can to help us assist in the troubleshooting process, including:

* Your operating system (e.g. Mac OS X, Linux) version. (For Mac OS X you can get this by clicking **About this Mac** in the Apple logo dropdown in the top left corner of your screen).
* The full text of any error message you are seeing with all associated output.
* The output of ``uname -a`` if possible.
* The output of ``python --version``.
* The output of ``pyenv versions`` if possible.
* The output of ``pip freeze`` if possible.

FYI you can capture the output of multiple commands in a single file like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ uname -a >> your_error_info.txt
    $ python --version >> your_error_info.txt
    $ pyenv versions >> your_error_info.txt
    $ pip freeze >> your_error_info.txt

You can then attach this file to any correspondence with us and it will likely allow us to resolve issues quicker.
