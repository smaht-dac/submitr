Installing smaht-submitr
========================


System Requirements
===================

* Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11
* ``pip`` (>=20.0.0)
* ``virtualenv`` (>=16.0.0)
* ``poetry`` (>=1.4.0)


Setting Up a Virtual Environment (OPTIONAL)
===========================================

This action is optional.
If you do not create a virtual environment, Poetry will make one for you.
But there are still good reasons you might want to make your own, so here
are three ways to do it:

* If you have a ``virtualenvwrapper`` installation that knows how to use your Python version (3.7, 3.8 or 3.9)::

   mkvirtualenv myenv

* If you have virtualenv but not virtualenvwrapper,
  and you have, for example, ``python3.9`` in your ``PATH``::

   virtualenv myenv -p python3.9

* If you are using ``pyenv`` to control what Python version you use, make sure you have set it
  to your preferred version and then do::

   pyenv exec python -m venv myenv


Activating a Virtual Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should execute all actions related to this repository
from within a virtual environment.

To activate a virtual environment::

   source myenv/bin/activate


Deactivating a Virtual Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's rarely necessary to deactivate a virtual environment.
One is automatically deactivated if you enter another,
and normally they have very little effect on other actions you might
take. So it's normally safe to just leave them activated.

However, if you want to deactivate an active environment, just do::

   deactivate


Installing in a Virtual Environment
==========================================

Installation for Developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are a developer, you'll be installing with Poetry.
Once you have created a virtual environment, or have decided to just let Poetry handle that,
go ahead with the installation. To do that, make sure your current directory is the source repository and do::

   make build


.. tip::

   Poetry is the substrate that our build scripts rely on.
   You won't be calling it directly, but ``make build`` will call it.


Installation for End Users (non-Developers)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're an end user,
once you have created and activated the virtual environment,
just do::

   pip install smaht-submitr
